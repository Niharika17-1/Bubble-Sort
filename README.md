# Bubble-Sort
Given an array, sort it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
# ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

# Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python to sort a list of integers in ascending order.

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
This process is repeated until the list becomes sorted.

# ðŸ”¹ Example

# Input:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
# Output:
[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

# ðŸš€ Approach

Traverse the list multiple times.
Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
Stop early if no swaps are made in a pass (optimization).
